# DeepLearning-Exercises

This repository contains various deep learning exercises and code implementations. The goal of this repository is to document my learning process in deep learning, covering a range of topics and models. Over time, I may also include replications of research papers as part of my ongoing studies.

<!-- ## Repository Structure

- `checkpoints/`: Saved model checkpoints from experiments.
- `data/`: Datasets used for the exercises.
- `Images/`: Images and visualizations generated during the experiments.
- `Tests/`: Contains test files or temporary scripts for debugging.
- `.ipynb` files: Jupyter notebooks containing different exercises and models including CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, and more.

## Featured Exercises

- **CNN Implementations**: Code exploring convolutional neural networks for image processing tasks.
- **RNN and GRU**: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) implementations.
- **Transformers**: Transformer models for sequence processing tasks.
- **LSTM**: Long Short-Term Memory models for sequence prediction and language translation.
- **Visualization**: Notebooks focused on visualizing results and model performance. -->

## Getting Started

To clone the repository and run the exercises:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
